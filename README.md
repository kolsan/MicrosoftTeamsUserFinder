Script in powershell that look in all Teams in Office 365 Tenant


I have created this script because i need to add an user to all teams that has any user with the same mail address domain. 
In order to use it we need to fill the domain in the line 25 and the user email address in line 46

Of course, prior to run the script, the powershell session must be connected to Office 365.
